The earliest phonographs were cylinder-based devices that used a needle to etch sound waves onto a rotating cylinder coated with wax or tin foil. These early machines were not designed for playback, but rather for recording and reproduction of spoken words and sounds. In the late 1880s, Thomas Edison developed the first practical phonograph that could both record and play back audio, using a spiral groove on a cylinder.\n", "\n", "> The next major innovation in recorded music came with the invention of flat discs, known as records, by Emile Berliner in the 1890s. Berliner's gramophone used a needle to etch grooves onto a flat disc made of shellac or other materials, which were then played back using a needle and a horn-shaped speaker. The first recordings on these flat discs were made around 1887, with Victor Records (founded by Eldridge R. Johnson) being one of the earliest commercial record labels.\n", "\n", "> The development of vinyl records in the early 20th century revolutionized the music industry. Vinyl was a more durable and long-lasting material than shellac, allowing for mass production and wider distribution of recorded music. The introduction of 78 rpm records (played at a speed of 78 revolutions per minute) around 1925 marked the beginning of the modern record player era. As radio broadcasting became popular, record players became a staple in many homes, allowing people to listen to their favorite artists and songs.\n", "\n", "> The post-war period saw significant improvements in record player technology, with the introduction of high-fidelity (hi-fi) stereophonic sound around 1950. Hi-fi systems used two channels (left and right) to reproduce music, providing a more immersive listening experience. The development of LPs (long-playing records) by Columbia Records in 1948 further increased record players' popularity, as they could store up to 23 minutes of music per side.\n", "\n", "> The rise of compact discs (CDs) and digital music formats in the late 20th century marked the beginning of the end for record players. CD players became widely available around the mid-1980s, offering higher sound quality and greater durability than vinyl records. By the early 2000s, CDs had largely replaced LPs as the preferred format for recorded music. However, in recent years, there has been a resurgence of interest in vinyl records, with many music fans seeking out vintage record players and new albums released on vinyl to enjoy the unique sound and tactile experience they offer.\n", "\n", "**&#167; Task:**  **Basic String functions.**\n", "\n", "Use the passage provided and answer the questions.  **Provide your answer in a Jupyter Notebook.**\n", "\n", "1.
